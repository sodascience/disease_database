Code to create a historical disease database (19th-20th century) for municipalities in the Netherlands.

_Cholera mention rates in the mid-1860s ([`source code`](src/analysis/create_map.R))_

This database was produced by:
- üöú Harvesting >80 million Dutch newspaper texts in the period 1830-1940 from [Delpher](https://www.delpher.nl/).
- üîé Finding mentions of locations and diseases in these texts via [hand-crafted regex](./raw_data/manual_input).
- üíΩ Processing the results and creating a user-friendly historical disease database for the following diseases:
  - cholera, diphteria, dysentery, influenza, malaria, measles, scarlet fever, smallpox, tuberculosis, and typhus.

## Installation

This project uses [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) to handle its dependencies. You can install them using pip like so:

```sh
pip install .
```

However, we recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage the environment. First, install uv, then clone / download this repo, then run:

```sh
uv sync
```

this will automatically install the right python version, create a virtual environment, and install the required packages. If you choose not to use `uv`, you can replace `uv run` in the code examples in this repo with `python`.

> üçè macOS note: if you encounter `error: command 'cmake' failed: No such file or directory`, you need to install [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) first, e.g., through `brew install cmake`. Similarly, you may have to install `apache-arrow` separately as well (`brew install apache-arrow`). Once these dependency issues are solved, run `uv sync` one more time.

## Running the data processing pipeline

The full data processing pipeline looks like this:

![disease database flow](img/disease_database_flow.svg)

Each of the separate processing steps (rectangles in the above image) has its own subfolder with its own readme documentation:
- Open archive processing in [`./src/process_open_archive/`](./src/process_open_archive/)
- Delpher API harvesting in [`./src/harvest_delpher_api/`](./src/harvest_delpher_api/)
- Final database creation in [`./src/create_database/`](./src/create_database/)


## Data analysis

For a basic analysis after the database has been created, take a look at the file [`src/analysis/query_db.py`](src/analysis/query_db.py).
